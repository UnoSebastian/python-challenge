# Py Me Up, Charlie

Hello! This is a demo project where I experimented with some scripts in python.

  * A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used.
  * An "analysis" folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.
  * In addition, the main script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
